For automatic start, cron is used, which runs the script MyTests.ipynb in jupyter notebook.

Cron is a built-in Linux service for running scripts on a schedule.

Sample file and cron setup:

Edit the cron file with the command:
crontab -e

add the following lines to it:
*/5 * * * * /usr/local/bin/jupyter nbconvert --execute --to html ~/MyTests.ipynb

Now the required script will run every 5 minutes.
